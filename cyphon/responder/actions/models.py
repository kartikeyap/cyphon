class Action(Endpoint):
    """
    Specifies the module and |Carrier| class that should be used to
    access an API endpoint of a |Destination|, such as JIRA. An |Action|
    can pass an |Alert| to the |Carrier|, which uses it to construct and
    send a request to the API endpoint. The |Action| then retrieves a
    |Dispatch| of the API response from the |Carrier|.

    Attributes
    ----------
    api_module : str
        The name of the module that will handle the API request
        (i.e., the name of the Python file without the extension,
        e.g., 'handlers').

    api_class : str
        The name of the class that will handle the API request
        (e.g., 'SearchAPI').

    visa_required : bool
        Whether requests to the API endpoint are rate limited.
        If |True|, an |Emissary| must have a |Visa| to access the
        |Endpoint|. The |Visa| defines the rate limit that should
        apply to the |Emissary|'s |Passport| (API key).

    platform : Destination
        The |Destination| representing the data platform which the API
        endpoint accesses.

    title : str
        A short description of the |Action|'s result' (e.g. "JIRA Issue").

    description : str
        A short description of the |Action| (e.g. "Create a JIRA Issue").

    """
    Provides a filter backend for a REST API endpoint. The backend can
    filter results for a Model using an object instance of another
    Model that may be related through a chain of forward relations.
    The backend searches the model graph for direct or indirect
    relationships between the two models, then uses the object instance
    to query for related objects.

    The backend searches for forward relationships defined by
    |ForeignKey|, |ManyToManyField|, and |OneToOneField| fields.
    It ignores reverse relations and |GenericForeignKey| fields.
    It also ignores fields and models specified by :attr:`~IGNORED_FIELDS`
    and :attr:`~IGNORED_MODELS`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        base_model : type
            The Model type representing the starting point when
            searching for paths to the `target_model` via forward
            relations.

        target_model : type
            A Model type representing the end point when searching
            for paths from the `base_model` via forward relations.

        handled_fields : `set` or `None`
            A set of Model fields that have been visited in the current
            path. Fields in this set are skipped if visited again.
            This avoids circular paths that would cause infinite
            recursions.

        current_lookup : `str` or `None`
            A lookup for the field at the current point in the path,
            starting from the `base_model`.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary with the keys 'filters' and 'exclude'.
            The value of 'filters' is a list of strings representing
            lookups for forward relations from the `base_model` to the
            `target model`. The value of 'exclude' is a subset of the
            `filters` list that should be used to exclude results that
            also relate to objects other than that specified in the
            filter query (e.g., ManyToManyFields that relate to both
            the specified object as well as other objects).

        This method intentionally ignores reverse relations.

        Warning

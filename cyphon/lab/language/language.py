    Uses Google's language detection algorithm to assign a language to
    a text string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text :str
        The text to classify.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The most likely language of the text that meets the
        :const:`~PROBABILTY` threshold, among the list of
        supported :const:`~LANGUAGES`. If no supported language meets
        the threshold, returns the value 'none'.

    Notes
    -----
    When associated with a field called "language", the string "none"
    tells MongoDB's text index to use simple tokenization with no list
    of stop words and no stemming. See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/text-search-languages/
    for more info.

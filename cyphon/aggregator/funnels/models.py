Defines a |Funnel| class, which funnels data from a |Pipe| through a
|DataCondenser| and into a |Bottle|.

Notes
-----

The |Funnel| class provides an intermediary model that controls the
many-to-many relationship between |DataCondensers| and |Pipes|.
It ensures that each |Pipe| is connected to only one |DataCondenser|
per |Bottle|.

**Rationale:**

In most cases, different |Pipes| will return data in different forms
(e.g., a tweet vs. an Instagram post). Thus, |Pipes| usually need
different |DataCondensers| to store data in a particular |Bottle|.
In some cases, however, |Pipes| may return data using the same model
(e.g., tweets returned by Twitter's Search API and Public Streams API).
In these cases, |Pipes| may use the same |DataCondenser| to store data
in a |Bottle|.

From the reverse persective, data from the same |Pipe| can be modeled
in different ways (i.e., stored in different |Bottles|). Thus, it is
possible for a |Pipe| to have more than one |Bottle| associated with it.

|DataCondensers| therefore have a many-to-one relationship with |Bottles|
and a many-to-many relationship with |Pipes|.

|Funnels| control these relationships to ensure that data flowing from
a |Pipe| have only one way to make into a given |Bottle|.

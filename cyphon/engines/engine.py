class Engine(BaseClass):
    """An interface for a data store.

    Base class used to define subclasses for interacting with specific
    data stores (such as MongoDB or Elasticsearch).

    An Engine performs CRUD operations on a set of documents in a
    data store that are represented by a |Collection|. The |Collection|
    can correspond to any one of the following:

        - a table in a relational database
        - a collection in a NoSQL database
        - a document type in a search engine index

    Essentially, an Engine shuttles documents to and from a storage
    location. It can insert or remove documents from that location and
    fetch query results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    collection : |Collection|
        The |Collection| that determines both the schema and the storage
        location of the documents to be handled by the Engine instance.

    Attributes
    ----------
    warehouse_collection : Collection
        The |Collection| that defines the storage location of the
        documents to be handled by the Engine instance.

    schema : `list` of `DataFields`
        |DataFields| that describe the nature of each field in the
        document type handled by the Engine.

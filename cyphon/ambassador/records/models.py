    Note
    ----
    Much of the information about the API call is stored in the

    to permit development of |Record| subclasses -- such as |Dispatches|
    and |Invoices| -- that have more specialized attributes, while still
    allowing information common to all API calls to be stored in the
    same database table -- the one for |Stamps|.
